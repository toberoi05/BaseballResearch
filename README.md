# Baseball Research Experimental Code
In this repository, there is one file that contains all the code I used to preprocess the Statcast data and generate the machine learning models and graphs used in my analysis.

## How to Open and Run the Code
To open the code onto a new Google Colaboratory file, click on the "Open in Colab" button after clicking on the colab file in this repository.
It should then redirect the current tab to a Google Colaboratory file where the code can be tested. In addition, the amount of RAM allotted should be 25 GB when the Colab file is opened.
